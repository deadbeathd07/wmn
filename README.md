## About Project

This application allows you to track data such as:
- mestruation
- fertile days
- ovulation

The application, based on the entered data, calculates the above items.

The application allows you to specify such data as:
- mood
- notes
- drugs taken
- sexual activity
- symptoms
  
It also allows you to track daily water intake, weight and body temperature.
The entered data is subject to change.


## Application view
The initial screen prompts you to read the terms of use of the application and accept these agreements. Then you are given the option to sign in to the app using Google or Apple accounts, or skip this step.

 On the next screen, you need to enter data for calculating future periods and other things. After entering the data, you will be taken to the tariff selection screen for using the application. At the moment, this screen carries only visual information and is only a decor. All information on it is fictitious.

 After completing all the preparatory operations, you find yourself on the main screen. The calendar displays all the data based on the values you entered earlier. It is also possible to change some settings, make notes and change the marked periods in the calendar.
